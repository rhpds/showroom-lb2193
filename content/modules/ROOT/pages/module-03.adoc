= Creating an Execution Environment

- In this section we will show you step by step how to build an Execution
Environment (EE) from code. You will also be publishing this EE to your
own private automation hub which you will use in the rest of the tasks.
+
NOTE: From that point onwards we will be able to configure the Platform using this execution environment which has all the required dependencies included. We will then make use of ansible-navigator as our tooling to run the configuration playbooks from then on.

== Task 1 - Create our EE Definition

- Create a file `+/home/lab-user/casc_lab/group_vars/all/ah_ee_list.yml+` where we will create a
list called `+ee_list+` that has 4 key things to set per item which are:
+
* `+name+` this is required and will be what the EE image will be called
* `+system+` this is any system packages that would be needed. Set under dependencies.
* `+python+` these are any python modules that need to be added through
pip (excluding ansible). Set under dependencies.
* `+galaxy+` any collections that you would like to be built into
your EE image. Set under dependencies.
+
which the role will loop over and for each item in this list it will
create and publish an EE using the provided variables. Take the example below and use this in your code.

== Task 2 - Double check your Execution Environments

- Check the file `/home/lab-user/casc_lab/group_vars/all/execution_environments.yml` and add make sure the `config_as_code` execution environment is there, you can also look in the gui.
It should be listed with image path `{{ aap_hostname }}/config_as_code` that is pull `always` and uses the credential `cr_ah`.

== Task 3 - Create the the Playbook
=== Create a playbook to build an EE

- The next step is to create a playbook/file `playbooks/build_ee.yml` which will run the ee_builder role to create the EE and push it to your Private Automation Hub.
+
[source,yaml,role=execute]
----
- name: Playbook to configure execution environments
  hosts: execution
  gather_facts: false
  connection: local
  vars_files:
    - "../vault.yml"
  tasks:
    - name: Include ee_builder role
      ansible.builtin.include_role:
        name: infra.ee_utilities.ee_builder
...
----


== Task 4 - Run the Playbook

- Run the playbook pointing to the recently created inventory file and limit the run to just execution to build your new custom EE and publish it to Private Automation Hub.
+ 
[source,console,role=execute]
----
ansible-playbook -i inventory.yml -l execution playbooks/build_ee.yml
----

on ansible-playbook]

== Task 5 - If the Playbook Fails

- Push your new custom EE and publish it to Private Automation Hub.
- Make sure to replace aap_hostname with your instance {nginx_web_url}, if this fails about overwriting an existing in the controller try a 2nd time it should work. This is an issue with the lab. 
+ 
[source,console,role=execute]
----
podman login #aap_hostname
podman push ##aap_hostname##/config_as_code
----

== Task 6 - See the Results

- Navigate to the AAP login with the provided passwords

- In each applications respective Execution Environment section on the left side you should find the `+config_as_code+` Execution Environment.
